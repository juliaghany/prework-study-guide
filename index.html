          <li>Some common elements used to divide or describe a page are meta-related elements, content divsion elements, and sematic elements.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, it is not visible to the user.</li>
          <li>Metadata is contained in the head element, and it is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li>
          <li>Inside the head element, you can use the metadata tags such as title, style, base, meta, script.</li>
