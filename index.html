      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>CSS: "Cascading Style Sheet" is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. It defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS
          style sheet.</li>
        <li>Inline CSS: used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file. This is useful for
          quick and permanent change, but less flexible than internal/external style sheets because each inline style
          must be edited individually when you make a design change.</li>
        <li>Internal CSS style sheet: when you embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style
          element in the head element. This contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. A
          single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
        <li>External CSS style sheet: this is the most commmon way to style a webpage. It allows developers to keep all
          their CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes design changes easier. When using this, we link the file using
          a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>Using a * symbol applies a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
        <li>When you combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, you allow the declarations to affect
          both selectors. This avoids unnecessary lines of code and repetition, which is also known as DRY (Do Not
          Repeat Yourself) code.</li>
        <li>Text-align is a positioning property and is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
        <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class
          attribute with a class selector.</li>
        <li>The link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
        <li>Selector: defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
