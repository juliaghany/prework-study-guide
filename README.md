# Julia's Pre-work Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Pre-work Study Guide was created for coding boot camp students going through the pre-work. It includes notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. I built this project in order to quickly access and overview information that I learned during the pre-work. This will allow me to study these topics all in one place. During this project, I learned how to add HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to my webpage. Throughout doing this, I learned about the importance of each language in the building process. I also learned how to use Git Bash to create a feature branch and merge my work from VS code to the main branch in my GitHub repository.

## Usage

To use this Pre-work Study Guide, you can review notes in each section. If you'd like suggestions on what to study first, you can open the ChromeDev Tools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). This should open a console panel either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. You can also access this by right clicking in the browser and selecting "Inspect". Once you've done this, you will move to the console tab, and that is where you'll find a list of topics we learned from the pre-work as well as a suggestion on which topic to start studying first.
